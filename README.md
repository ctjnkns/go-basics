## XKCD Search
Demonstrates usage of go command line arguments, file IO, error handling, http requests, and json encoding. `xkcd-load.go` pulls all comics from xkcd.com and writes them to a local file in json format. `xkcd-find.go` searches the file and returns comics that match the given terms.

## Web Server
Demonstrates usage of the http package to start a basic web server and handle API requests. Supports listing, reading, adding, updating, and deleting items using API calls with a simulated store database.
